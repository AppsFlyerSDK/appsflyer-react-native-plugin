### <a id="plugin-build-for"> This plugin is built for

- Android AppsFlyer SDK **v6.15.2**
- iOS AppsFlyer SDK **v6.15.3**
- Tested with React-Native **v0.62.0** (older versions might be supported)

## <a id="breaking-changes"> ❗❗ Breaking changes when updating to v6.x.x❗❗

- From version `6.15.1`, upgraded to targetSDKVersion 34, Java 17, and Gradle 8.7 in [AppsFlyer Android SDK v6.15.1](https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001256006-AppsFlyer-Android-SDK-release-notes).

- From version `6.15.1`, iOS Minimum deployment target is set to 12.0.

- From version `6.3.0`, we use `xcframework` for iOS platform. Then you need to use cocoapods version >= 1.10

- From version `6.2.30`, `logCrossPromotionAndOpenStore` api will register as `af_cross_promotion` instead of `af_app_invites` in your dashboard.<br>
  Click on a link that was generated using `generateInviteLink` api will be register as `af_app_invites`.

- From version `6.0.0` we have renamed the following APIs:

| Old API                       | New API                       |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| trackEvent                    | logEvent                      |
| trackLocation                 | logLocation                   |
| stopTracking                  | stop                          |
| trackCrossPromotionImpression | logCrossPromotionImpression   |
| trackAndOpenStore             | logCrossPromotionAndOpenStore |
| setDeviceTrackingDisabled     | anonymizeUser                 |
| AppsFlyerTracker              | AppsFlyerLib                  |

And removed the following ones:

- trackAppLaunch -> no longer needed. See new init guide
- sendDeepLinkData -> no longer needed. See new init guide
- enableUninstallTracking -> no longer needed. See new uninstall measurement guide

If you have used 1 of the removed APIs, please check the integration guide for the updated instructions.
