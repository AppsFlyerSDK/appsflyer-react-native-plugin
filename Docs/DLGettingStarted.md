## Deep Linking Types:
1. **Deferred Deep Linking** - Serving personalized content to new or former users, directly after the installation. 
2. **Direct Deep Linking** - Directly serving personalized content to existing users, which already have the mobile app installed.

** Unified deep linking (UDL) ** - an  API which enables you to send new and existing users to a specific in-app activity as soon as the app is opened.
